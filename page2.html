            <p class="paragraph-1">Enthusiasts have long been an integral part of America’s car culture.
                Some followed the reliability runs and Vanderbilt Cup races at the
                dawn of the automobile age. Others modified Model- T and Model A
                Fords for better performance during the interwar years. Many
                watched the post-World War II sports-car races at Watkins Glen or
                Laguna Seca, while others cheered their stock car heroes in the
                Piedmont South. Some built hot rods and customs during the 1950s
                and 1960. Others, instead, made monthly payments on muscle
                cars. Today there are “Ford folks” and “Chevy folks”, “Honda folks”
                and “VW folks,” “Jaguar folks” and “Corvette folks,”
                hot rodders and restorers, drag racers and road
                racers, and the list goes on and on.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Common ground among these niches is scarce.
                On the business side, there is the automotive
                aftermarket, a multi billion dollar a year industry
                supplying the parts and equipment enthusiasts
                use to personalize and restore their cars. There is
                also the “buff book” business, another milion
                dollar a year industry generating scores of
                periodicals each month
                and books each year.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-3">Cross-niche links among
                individual enthusiasts
                are less common, and
                rarely quite so broad.
                Some who build hot rods
                also restore high-end
                Packards, and some who
                rebuild factory correct
                Mustangs also follow
                Formula One racing. But
                apart from those whose
                interests happen to span
                the spectrum, and apart
                from the parts suppliers and publishing houses, what else is there
                that permits us to speak of “automobile enthusiasts” as a cohesive
                group? Put another way, what does it really mean to be a “gearhead”?</p>
            <p class="paragraph-4">One way to address the question is to shift our focus from their gears
                to their heads. For although its many niches rarely mix any better
                than oil and water, certain attitudes and approaches do thread their
                way through most of the enthusiast community. There is, for
                example, a deeply held distrust of regulatory advocates. Not everyone
                who drives a classic American car or a vintage Volkswagen
                literally has a dartboard in the garage centered on a photograph of
                Ralph Nader, of course. But figuratively, many do. There is also an
                obsession with perfection, with getting their cars right and keeping them that way. Not every enthusiast actually owns a show-worthy
                car, but the pursuit of automotive perfection
                whatever “perfection”
                means within a particular niche’ is central. So, too, is an almost
                morbid obsession
                with out of service
                cars, the wrecked and rusting hulks
                that reside in junkyards, backyards,
                and rural settings
                Though it is not
                quite universal, this fascination
                with
                the mortal remains of yesterday’s
                vehicles is sufficiently widespread
                to warrant a closer look.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-5">Enthusiast publications have run
                photographs and stories
                on out of
                service cars in various states of
                disrepair for many years. Typically,
                these have appeared in one of three
                contexts. First are the many feature
                articles about finished, show worthy
                cars emphasizing that the vehicles
                then restored. These normally include before- and after shots to
                emphasize the ragsto
                riches angle.’ Second are the magazines’
                ubiquitous how-to technical articles. Covering everything from
                tune-ups and transmissions to basic bodywork, these often feature
                fully illustrated advice on how to locate junkyard parts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-6">Third, and most telling, are the regular sections in enthusiast
                periodicals which feature photographs and stories of derelict
                cars in junkyards, and other settings exactly as they are, wrecked,
                cut-up, and rusting away. This sort of coverage first appeared on a
                limited basis during the 1970s in the street-rod oriented Rod and
                Custom’s “Vintage Tin” section. Then it rapidly spread to other
                periodicals during the 1980s and 1990s. Today it is ubiquitous. For
                the classic-car crowd, there’s “Weathered Wheels” in Oul Cars
                Weekly. Hot rod and muscle car enthusiasts enjoy Hot Rod’s “Hidden
                Treasure of the Month.” Two publications ppublipublications cater
                to road-racing and sports-car fans Classic Motorsports’
                “Ran
                When Parked” and Classic Sports Car’s “Reader Find of the
                Month.” For modern tuner car enthusiasts, there’s European Cars
                “Money Shot” for classic Volkswagen enthusiasts, the “Fertig”
                segment in VW Trends as well as occasional coverage in Hot VWs.
                For Gen-Xers in the mid-2000s, a magazine called MPH regularly
                covered totaled Porsches, Ferraris, and Lamborghinis in a section
                titled “Wrecked Exotics.” More mainstream reader could consult
                the “PS” page in Road and Track and the “Reader Sightings” feature
                in Car and Driver. The longest-running of these segments
                appeared
                in the restoriation restoration-oriented Cars and Parts for nearly
                thirty years it published deep and lavishly
                illustrated coverage of
                enthusiast-oriented salvage yards in every issue .’ Finally, those with more than a passing interest in junked cars can find prints of artists’
                renderings, photographs of junkyards in web-based collections,
                numerous books, and calendars featuring full-color images of
                wrecked and abandoned vehicles in a variety of settings.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-7">On the surface, the visual content of these presentations
                differs
                little from that produced by “urban explorers,” those who trek
                through the ruins of the Rust Belt
                (mostly contained in the
                northeastern, the midwestern,
                and some sections of the
                southeastern United States),
                video- or still-camera in hand,
                documenting
                urban blight and
                industrial decay and posting
                their “findings” on YouTube and
                other online forums. Unlike
                serious scholars of industrial
                archaeology, however,
                these
                explorers and their fans in cyber
                space are less interested in the
                material reality of the industrial
                past than they are in its present
                decay. (Mostly for aesthetic and
                content-creation purposes,
                without an in depth understanding of the environmental
                and historical factors involved). The same is true of
                many of the aforementioned derelict car features.
                Both convey a sense of resignation often mixed with
                an almost voyeuristic delight-as yet another piece
                of the industrial past slips away, whether a factory
                in Detroit or the remnants of an automobile
                assembled there.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-8">But among enthusiasts, there is a vital twist to all of
                this. Hot Rod’s derelict-car feature, “Hidden
                Treasure of the Month,” is aptly titled, because many enthusiasts
                have long viewed junked or otherwise abandoned cars as
                treasure. In other words, the wrecks featured in their periodicals
                represent more than tragic reminders
                of what once was. They
                also represent potential-as sources of parts for the restoration
                and modification of project vehicles or as starting points for
                those projects. In fact, precisely because they actively seek to
                re-use these rusting relics, car enthusiasts sometimes call
                themselves America’s “first recyclers.” This is a fantasy, as those
                familiar with the history of recycling in the United States are well
                aware. Nevertheless, many present-day automobile enthusiasts
                do operate within a well-established mindset that values the
                re-use or repurposing
                of abandoned- or scrapped-car “treasure.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph-9">This has not always been the case. The treasure metaphor
                itself did
                not appear until after World War II, and not until the late 1970s was
                it firmly established. But the behavior and the approach to the
                automobile that it represents has been developing since the 1910s.
                This essay examines the emergence of this culture of re-use,
                restoration, and re-purposing by looking at three critical periods.
                The first is the 1920s through the mid-1950s when high
                performance enthusiasts began to place a premium on parts from
                certain types of wrecked cars. The second is the 1950s when the
                mainstream antique and classic-car restoration hobby emerged
                along with the treasure-hunting mindset. The third is the 1960s
                through the 1980s when nostalgic high-performance enthusiasts
                known as street rodders began to re-purpose automotive scrap on
                a widespread scale, embracing
                their status as treasure
                hunters and “direct recyclers”
                along the way.</p>
